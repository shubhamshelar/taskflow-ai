## üö´ Rules to Follow

### DO
- Commit code daily (even small changes)
- Test every endpoint before moving on
- Write clean, readable code
- Document as you build
- Ask specific technical questions when stuck

### DON'T
- Skip to next week if current week isn't complete
- Add features not in the plan
- Spend more than 30 minutes on any single bug
- Compare with other projects online
- Change tech stack mid-project

---

## üÜò When You Get Stuck

### Daily Issues (< 30 mins)
- Google the exact error
- Check Stack Overflow
- Review Spring Boot documentation

### Bigger Problems (> 30 mins)
- Post specific question with error logs
- Take a break and return with fresh eyes
- Simplify the current task

### Weekly Check-ins
- Review what you built
- Identify what you learned
- Plan improvements for next week

---

## üéØ After Completion

### Next Steps
1. **Add this to resume** with live demo link
2. **Write blog post** about what you learned
3. **Start project #2** with different domain (e.g., e-commerce API)
4. **Apply for backend roles** with confidence

### Interview Preparation
- Be ready to explain every technical decision
- Demonstrate the API live during interviews
- Discuss challenges you faced and solved
- Show the codebase architecture

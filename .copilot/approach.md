## Your Daily Development Flow

### Phase 1: Quick Setup & Direction
**What to do:**
- Review what you built yesterday (if anything)
- Google the specific thing you need to implement today
- Find ONE working example to reference
- Clear your head about today's single goal

**Time sense:** Should feel quick and focused, not deep research

### Phase 2: Core Building (The Bulk)
**What to do:**
- Write the main functionality for today
- Copy-modify-adapt from examples when needed
- Test small pieces as you go (don't wait until the end)
- Focus on "make it work" over "make it perfect"
- When you hit errors, try 2-3 quick fixes before asking for help

**Time sense:** This is your main coding time - should feel productive and hands-on

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing
**What to do:**
- Test your feature thoroughly with Postman/browser
- Fix any obvious bugs
- Make sure you actually achieved today's goal
- If something doesn't work, either fix it or note it for tomorrow

**Time sense:** Shorter than Phase 2, but important - don't skip this

### Phase 4: Wrap-up & Forward Planning
**What to do:**
- Add comments to explain what you built
- Commit to GitHub with a clear message
- Jot down what confused you or what you want to improve
- Set a clear, simple goal for tomorrow

**Time sense:** Quick but essential - sets you up for success tomorrow

## Your Mental Approach Throughout:

- **"What's the minimum that works?"** rather than "What's the perfect solution?"
- **Build something, then improve it** rather than perfect planning
- **Ask specific questions when stuck** rather than general theory
- **Progress over perfection** - every working feature counts

## When to Reach Out AI Agent:

- Stuck on the same error for more than you'd expect
- Code works but you're unsure if you're on the right track
- Need to check if your approach aligns with your weekly goals
